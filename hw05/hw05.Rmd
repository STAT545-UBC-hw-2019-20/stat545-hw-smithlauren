# Exercise 1: Explain the value of the here::here package

_In your own words, summarize the value of the here::here package in 250 words or fewer._

From my understanding, the here::here package is valuable because it allows you to more easily specify where you want a file to be created. It makes the data more accessible to other people (and across operating systems) as well. 

# Exercise 2: Factor management

_2.1 Choose one dataset and a variable to explore._

The data set that I will explore is 'gapminder' and the variable is 'country'.

```{r, read in gapminder dataset}
data(gapminder)
gapminder
```

```{r, confirm that variable of interest is a factor}
CO2$Treatment %>%
  str()
```

_2.2After ensuring the variable(S) you're exploring are indeed factors, you should:_

_2.2.1. Drop factor/levels;_
```{r, drop factor(s)}
new_gap <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Norway", "Germany", "Chile", "Canada", "Uganda", "Italy"))

new_gap$country %>%
  nlevels()
```

```{r}
new_gap_dropped <- new_gap %>%
  droplevels()
new_gap_dropped
```


_2.3Explore the effects of re-leveling a factor in a tibble by:_

_2.3.1. comparing the results of `arrange` on the original and re-leveled factor._


Now that the data have been filtered and unused levels dropped, we can create bar plots to see how many entries are present in each continent of interest. 
Let's see what using 'arrange' looks like first. 
```{r}
new_gap_dropped %>%
  arrange(continent) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Before Reordering", x = "Continents", y = "Count of Entries")
```


_2.3.2. Plotting a figure of before/after re-leveling the factor (make sure to assign the factor to an aesthetic of your choosing)._


Now let's use the fct_reorder function to put the bars in order of maximum life expectancy.
```{r}
new_gap_dropped %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(fct_reorder(continent, lifeExp, max))) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "After Reordering based on Maximum Life Expectancy", x = "Continents", y = "Count of Entries")
```

_Explore the effects of re-leveling a factor in a tibble by:_

_1. comparing the results of `arrange` on the original and re-leveled factor._

_2. Plotting a figure of before/after re-leveling the factor (make sure to assign the factor to an aesthetic of your choosing)._



# Exercise 3: File input/output (I/O)

_Experiment with at least one of:_

_- `write_csv()/read_csv()`_

_- `saveRDS()/readRDS()`_

_- `dput()/dget()`_



# Exercise 4: Visualization design

_Go back through your previous assignments and class participation activities and find figures you created prior to the last week of the course. Recreate at least one figure in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color._

_Task: Create a side-by-side plot and juxtapose your first attempt (show the original figure as-is) with a revised attempt after some time spent working on it and implementing principles of effective plotting principles. Comment and reflect on the differences._


# Exercise 5: Writing figures to file

_Task: Use `ggsave()` to explicitly save a plot to file. Include the exported plot as part of your repository and assignment._

_Then, use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to load and embed that file into your report. You can play around with various options, such as:_

_- Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling._

_- Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format._

_- Explicit provision of the plot object `p` via `ggsave(..., plot = p)`. Show a situation in which this actually matters._
