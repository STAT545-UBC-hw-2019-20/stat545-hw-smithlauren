# Task Option 1
_Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year._
```{r}
global_mean <- gapminder %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(lifeExp))
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp < global_mean)
```




# Task Option 2
_Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents._
```{r}

```



# Task Option 5
_How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?_
```{r}
